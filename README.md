### The Problem 

The evil carSun is heading straight for Earth, and it's melting everything! Top scientist Lian figures out that in order to defeat carSun, the amount of rockets they fire must be a **perfect number**. 

A perfect number is a number such that all of its factors (including one, excluding itself) can be added up to equal that number. For example, 6 is the first perfect number, because its factors: 1, 2, 3 add up to 6. (1+2+3=6)

Lian calls up Tristan and Brooks to help him find perfect numbers. 

### Your Mission 

Write a function `perfect_number` that that determines whether or not a number is a perfect number. 

### Parameters and return value

- Your function should take in a parameter, `n`, which is any given number
- Your function should return `True` or `False` depending on whether or not the number is a perfect number
