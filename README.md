### The Problem 

The evil carSun is heading straight for Earth, and it's melting everything! Top scientist Lian figures out that in order to defeat carSun, the amount of rockets they fire must be a **perfect number**. 

A perfect number is a number such that all of its factors (including one, excluding itself) can be added up to equal that number. For example, 6 is the first perfect number, because its factors: 1, 2, 3 add up to 6. (1+2+3=6)

Lian calls up Tristan and Brooks to help him figure out the first four perfect numbers in the number system. 

### Your Mission 

Write a function `perfect_number` that takes in no parameters, but finds the first four perfect numbers.
